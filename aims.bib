	abstract = {Although circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) assays are increasingly used to inform clinical decisions in cancer care, they have limited ability to identify the transcriptional programs that govern cancer phenotypes and their dynamic changes during the course of disease. To address these limitations, we developed a method for comprehensive epigenomic profiling of cancer from 1 ml of patient plasma. Using an immunoprecipitation-based approach targeting histone modifications and DNA methylation, we measured 1,268 epigenomic profiles in plasma from 433 individuals with one of 15 cancers. Our assay provided a robust proxy for transcriptional activity, allowing us to infer the expression levels of diagnostic markers and drug targets, measure the activity of therapeutically targetable transcription factors and detect epigenetic mechanisms of resistance. This proof-of-concept study in advanced cancers shows how plasma epigenomic profiling has the potential to unlock clinically actionable information that is currently accessible only via direct tissue sampling.},

We analyzed whole-genome sequencing data from 2,511 individuals in the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) study as well as 489 individuals from four prospective cohorts and found distinct regional mutation type-specific frequencies in tissue and cell-free DNA from patients with cancer that were associated with replication timing and other chromatin features. A machine-learning model using genome-wide mutational profiles combined with other features and followed by CT imaging detected {\textgreater}90\% of patients with lung cancer, including those with stage I and II disease. The fixed model was validated in an independent cohort, detected patients with cancer earlier than standard approaches and could be used to monitor response to therapy. This approach lays the groundwork for non-invasive cancer detection using genome-wide mutation features that may facilitate cancer screening and monitoring.},

	abstract = {Early cancer detection by cell-free DNA faces multiple challenges: low fraction of tumor cell-free DNA, molecular heterogeneity of cancer, and sample sizes that are not sufficient to reflect diverse patient populations. Here, we develop a cancer detection approach to address these challenges. It consists of an assay, cfMethyl-Seq, for cost-effective sequencing of the cell-free DNA methylome (with {\textgreater} 12-fold enrichment over whole genome bisulfite sequencing in CpG islands), and a computational method to extract methylation information and diagnose patients. Applying our approach to 408 colon, liver, lung, and stomach cancer patients and controls, at 97.9\% specificity we achieve 80.7\% and 74.5\% sensitivity in detecting all-stage and early-stage cancer, and 89.1\% and 85.0\% accuracy for locating tissue-of-origin of all-stage and early-stage cancer, respectively. Our approach cost-effectively retains methylome profiles of cancer abnormalities, allowing us to learn new features and expand to other cancer types as training cohorts grow.},

	abstract = {Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) from the bloodstream has been studied for cancer biomarker discovery, and chromatin-derived epigenetic features have come into the spotlight for their potential to expand clinical applications. Methylation, fragmentation, and nucleosome positioning patterns of cfDNA have previously been shown to reveal epigenomic and inferred transcriptomic information. More recently, histone modifications have emerged as a tool to further identify tumor-specific chromatin variants in plasma. A number of sequencing methods have been developed to analyze these epigenetic markers, offering new insights into tumor biology. Features within cfDNA allow for cancer detection, subtype and tissue of origin classification, and inference of gene expression. These methods provide a window into the complexity of cancer and the dynamic nature of its progression. In this review, we highlight the array of epigenetic features in cfDNA that can be extracted from chromatin- and nucleosome-associated organization and outline potential use cases in cancer management.},

	abstract = {Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in human plasma provides access to molecular information about the pathological processes in the organs or tumors from which it originates. These DNA fragments are derived from fragmented chromatin in dying cells and retain some of the cell-of-origin histone modifications. In this study, we applied chromatin immunoprecipitation of cell-free nucleosomes carrying active chromatin modifications followed by sequencing (cfChIP-seq) to 268 human samples. In healthy donors, we identified bone marrow megakaryocytes, but not erythroblasts, as major contributors to the cfDNA pool. In patients with a range of liver diseases, we showed that we can identify pathology-related changes in hepatocyte transcriptional programs. In patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma, we detected clinically relevant and patient-specific information, including transcriptionally active human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) amplifications. Altogether, cfChIP-seq, using low sequencing depth, provides systemic and genome-wide information and can inform diagnosis and facilitate interrogation of physiological and pathological processes using blood samples.},

	abstract = {DNA methylation is an epigenetic mechanism that contributes to cell regulation and development, and different methylation patterns allow for the identification of cell and tissue type. Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is composed of small circulating fragments of DNA found in plasma and urine. Total cfDNA levels correlate with the presence of inflammation and tissue injury in a variety of disease states. Unfortunately, the utility of cfDNA is limited by its lack of tissue or cell-type specificity. However, methylome analysis of cfDNA allows the identification of the tissue or cell type from which cfDNA originated. Thus, methylation patterns in cfDNA from tissues isolated from direct study may provide windows into health and disease states, thereby serving as a “liquid biopsy”. This review will discuss methylation and its role in establishing cellular identity, cfDNA as a biomarker and its pathophysiologic role in the inflammatory process, and the ways cfDNA and methylomics can be jointly applied in medicine.},

This includes histone H3 lysine 36 trimethylation (H3K36me3), a marker of active transcription. We hypothesised that cell-free chromatin immunoprecipitation (cfChIP) of H3K36me3-modified nucleosomes present in blood plasma can delineate tumour gene expression levels. H3K36me3 cfChIP followed by targeted NGS (cfChIP-seq) was performed on blood plasma samples from non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients (NSCLC, n = 8), small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients (SCLC, n = 4) and healthy controls (n = 4). H3K36me3 cfChIP-seq demonstrated increased enrichment of mutated alleles compared with normal alleles in plasma from patients with known somatic cancer mutations. Additionally, genes identified to be differentially expressed in SCLC and NSCLC tumours had concordant H3K36me3 cfChIP enrichment profiles in NSCLC (sensitivity = 0.80) and SCLC blood plasma (sensitivity = 0.86). Findings here expand the utility of cfDNA in liquid biopsies to characterise treatment resistance, cancer subtyping and disease progression.},
