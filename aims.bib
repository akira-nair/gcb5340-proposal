	abstract = {Although circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) assays are increasingly used to inform clinical decisions in cancer care, they have limited ability to identify the transcriptional programs that govern cancer phenotypes and their dynamic changes during the course of disease. To address these limitations, we developed a method for comprehensive epigenomic profiling of cancer from 1 ml of patient plasma. Using an immunoprecipitation-based approach targeting histone modifications and DNA methylation, we measured 1,268 epigenomic profiles in plasma from 433 individuals with one of 15 cancers. Our assay provided a robust proxy for transcriptional activity, allowing us to infer the expression levels of diagnostic markers and drug targets, measure the activity of therapeutically targetable transcription factors and detect epigenetic mechanisms of resistance. This proof-of-concept study in advanced cancers shows how plasma epigenomic profiling has the potential to unlock clinically actionable information that is currently accessible only via direct tissue sampling.},

Methylation, fragmentation, and nucleosome positioning patterns of cfDNA have previously been shown to reveal epigenomic and inferred transcriptomic information. More recently, histone modifications have emerged as a tool to further identify tumor-specific chromatin variants in plasma. A number of sequencing methods have been developed to analyze these epigenetic markers, offering new insights into tumor biology. Features within cfDNA allow for cancer detection, subtype and tissue of origin classification, and inference of gene expression. These methods provide a window into the complexity of cancer and the dynamic nature of its progression. In this review, we highlight the array of epigenetic features in cfDNA that can be extracted from chromatin- and nucleosome-associated organization and outline potential use cases in cancer management.},

Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is composed of small circulating fragments of DNA found in plasma and urine. Total cfDNA levels correlate with the presence of inflammation and tissue injury in a variety of disease states. Unfortunately, the utility of cfDNA is limited by its lack of tissue or cell-type specificity. However, methylome analysis of cfDNA allows the identification of the tissue or cell type from which cfDNA originated. Thus, methylation patterns in cfDNA from tissues isolated from direct study may provide windows into health and disease states, thereby serving as a “liquid biopsy”. This review will discuss methylation and its role in establishing cellular identity, cfDNA as a biomarker and its pathophysiologic role in the inflammatory process, and the ways cfDNA and methylomics can be jointly applied in medicine.},

H3K36me3 cfChIP-seq demonstrated increased enrichment of mutated alleles compared with normal alleles in plasma from patients with known somatic cancer mutations. Additionally, genes identified to be differentially expressed in SCLC and NSCLC tumours had concordant H3K36me3 cfChIP enrichment profiles in NSCLC (sensitivity = 0.80) and SCLC blood plasma (sensitivity = 0.86).

	abstract = {Background
Detecting organ and tissue damage is essential for early diagnosis, treatment decisions, and monitoring disease progression. Methylation-based assays offer a promising approach, as DNA methylation patterns can change in response to tissue damage. These assays have potential applications in early detection, monitoring disease progression, evaluating treatment efficacy, and assessing organ viability for transplantation. cfDNA released into the bloodstream upon tissue or organ injury can serve as a biomarker for damage. The epigenetic state of cfDNA, including DNA methylation patterns, can provide insights into the extent of tissue and organ damage.

Content
Firstly, this review highlights DNA methylation as an extensively studied epigenetic modification that plays a pivotal role in processes such as cell growth, differentiation, and disease development. It then presents a variety of highly precise 5-mC methylation detection techniques that serve as powerful tools for gaining profound insights into epigenetic alterations linked with tissue damage. Subsequently, the review delves into the mechanisms underlying DNA methylation changes in organ and tissue damage, encompassing inflammation, oxidative stress, and DNA damage repair mechanisms. Next, it addresses the current research status of cfDNA methylation in the detection of specific organ tissues and organ damage. Finally, it provides an overview of the multiple steps involved in identifying specific methylation markers associated with tissue and organ damage for clinical trials.

Summary
This review will explore the mechanisms and current state of research on cfDNA methylation-based assay detecting organ and tissue damage, the underlying mechanisms, and potential applications in clinical practice.},

	abstract = {Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) analysis represents a promising method for the diagnosis, treatment selection and clinical follow-up of cancer patients. Although its general methodological feasibility and usefulness has been demonstrated, several issues related to standardisation and technical validation must be addressed for its routine clinical application in cancer. In this regard, most cfDNA clinical applications are still limited to clinical trials, proving its value in several settings. In this paper, we review the current clinical trials involving cfDNA/ctDNA analysis and highlight those where it has been useful for patient stratification, treatment follow-up or development of novel approaches for early diagnosis. Our query included clinical trials, including the terms ‘cfDNA’, ‘ctDNA’, ‘liquid biopsy’ AND ‘cancer OR neoplasm’ in the FDA and EMA public databases. We identified 1370 clinical trials (FDA = 1129, EMA = 241) involving liquid-biopsy analysis in cancer. These clinical trials show promising results for the early detection of cancer and confirm cfDNA as a tool for real-time monitoring of acquired therapy resistance, accurate disease-progression surveillance and improvement of treatment, situations that result in a better quality of life and extended overall survival for cancer patients.},

From whole-genome sequencing, we retrieve the cfDNA fragment-end composition using a new software (FrEIA [fragment end integrated analysis]), as well as the cfDNA size and tumor fraction in three independent cohorts (n = 925 cancer from {\textgreater}10 types and 321 control samples). At 95\% specificity, we detect 72\% cancer samples using at least one cfDNA measure, including 64\% early-stage cancer (n = 220). cfDNA detection correlates with a shorter overall (p = 0.0086) and recurrence-free (p = 0.017) survival in patients with resectable esophageal adenocarcinoma. Integrating cfDNA measures with machine learning in an independent test set (n = 396 cancer, 90 controls) achieve a detection accuracy of 82\% and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.96. In conclusion, harnessing the biological features of cfDNA can improve, at no extra cost, the diagnostic performance of liquid biopsies.},

	abstract = {Multimodal epigenetic characterization of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) could improve the performance of blood-based early cancer detection. However, integrative profiling of cfDNA methylome and fragmentome has been technologically challenging. Here, we adapt an enzyme-mediated methylation sequencing method for comprehensive analysis of genome-wide cfDNA methylation, fragmentation, and copy number alteration (CNA) characteristics for enhanced cancer detection. We apply this method to plasma samples of 497 healthy controls and 780 patients of seven cancer types and develop an ensemble classifier by incorporating methylation, fragmentation, and CNA features. In the test cohort, our approach achieves an area under the curve value of 0.966 for overall cancer detection. Detection sensitivity for early-stage patients achieves 73\% at 99\% specificity. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility to accurately localize the origin of cancer signals with combined methylation and fragmentation profiling of tissue-specific accessible chromatin regions. Overall, this proof-of-concept study provides a technical platform to utilize multimodal cfDNA features for improved cancer detection.},

Here we report ichorCNA, software that quantifies tumor content in cfDNA from 0.1× coverage whole-genome sequencing data without prior knowledge of tumor mutations. We apply ichorCNA to 1439 blood samples from 520 patients with metastatic prostate or breast cancers. In the earliest tested sample for each patient, 34\% of patients have ≥10\% tumor-derived cfDNA, sufficient for standard coverage whole-exome sequencing. Using whole-exome sequencing, we validate the concordance of clonal somatic mutations (88\%), copy number alterations (80\%), mutational signatures, and neoantigens between cfDNA and matched tumor biopsies from 41 patients with ≥10\% cfDNA tumor content. In summary, we provide methods to identify patients eligible for comprehensive cfDNA profiling, revealing its applicability to many patients, and demonstrate high concordance of cfDNA and metastatic tumor whole-exome sequencing.},
